**Being a teenage coder is quite the adventure.** Late nights spent figuring out bugs, tons of half-finished projects, and that constant question: “Should I share this, or just keep it to myself?”

This is the story of one project I actually decided to share. It surprised me in ways I never expected, attracted some… interesting users (hello, “adult” fanpages), and taught me a lot about coding, life, and why server bills are no joke. Let’s dive in!

## 1. A Perfectionist’s Confession

I’ve been coding since I was in 6th grade. Over the years, I’ve created tons of projects, but almost none of them ever saw the light of day. Why? Because I’m a _perfectionist_.

If my project wasn’t 100% perfect—whether it was the features or how the code looked—I’d refuse to share it. It didn’t matter if no one else noticed the flaws. To me, if it wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t good enough.

But this project was different. It was the **first one I ever shared online**, and to my surprise, it did really well! For a 9th grader, I’d call it a success. It achieved results I never imagined, and honestly, I was pretty proud of it.


##  2. The Backstory: Ninjas and Necessity

Before I explain how I came up with the idea, let’s talk about what was happening back then.

At the time, I was a member of **J2team**, a tech group on Facebook. It was an amazing place with active members and lots of shared resources. They even had a special system called **AnLink**, created by Nguyen Huu Dat, to protect the group’s content.

This system blocked people known as “**ninjas**”—those who would use the group’s resources without so much as a "thank you" or even a simple reaction. The system made sure people had to engage with posts (comment or react) before accessing the content.

The problem? **AnLink only worked for J2team.** Meanwhile, I was running a group with over **10,000 members**. My group also had its fair share of ninjas, so I needed something similar for us. That’s how **HideContent.ml** came to life.


## 3. Enter: HideContent.ml

**What is HideContent.ml?** It’s a system I built to help group and fanpage admins boost engagement by hiding content behind certain actions.

Here’s how it worked:

1.  **Admins create a system** on HideContent.ml.
2.  **They create hidden content links** by:
    -   Picking their system.
    -   Entering the content or link they want to hide.
    -   Choosing how to unlock it (password, reacting to a post, or commenting).
    -   Getting a shortened link.
3.  Admins post this link on Facebook.
4.  Users who want to see the hidden content must complete the required action.

It was simple but effective—a perfect way to turn silent scrollers into active participants.

## 4. My Jaw-Dropping Discovery

At its peak, **HideContent.ml had 100 users online at the same time** and over **2,000 hidden links created**. Pretty impressive, right? But the real surprise came when I looked at who was using it.

The most active users? _“Adult” fanpages and groups._ These were pages with thousands of members and over 100k likes. Apparently, there was a high demand for systems like this in certain… let’s just say _niche communities_.

Even more shocking were the admins running these pages. They weren’t who I expected. Let’s just say their profiles looked way too “professional” for what they were managing. Honestly, it was both funny and a little unsettling. Let’s leave it at that! 😅

## 5. The Shutdown Saga: Too Broke to Continue

Eventually, I had to shut **HideContent.ml** down. The reason? **It was too expensive to keep running.** As a 9th grader, I couldn’t handle the operating costs—it was way out of my budget.

But even after I shut it down, I started getting tons of messages. Admins of groups and fanpages kept asking me to sell the source code. They were offering money, but I wasn’t ready to deal with that. At the time, I didn’t even have a bank account, and handling transactions felt like too much work. So, I said no.

## 6. A 9th Grader's Video Demo to this sytem

**Disclaimer:**
1. Viewer discretion is advised. Let's just say, my UI/UX skills from **8 years ago** were... interesting. Kind of like a toddler trying to paint the Mona Lisa. But hey, we all start somewhere, right?
2. Back then, I was more comfortable talking to a brick wall than a video recording. So, let's dive into this text-based tutorial (Vietnamese).

## Conclusion: The Accidental Success

Looking back, creating **HideContent.ml** was an amazing experience. It started as a small idea to help my group but ended up growing way beyond what I expected. It taught me a lot—not just about coding but also about dealing with people, handling surprises, and understanding the costs of running a project.

Would I do it again? Absolutely. But next time, I’d make sure I had a way to handle the bills!
