In today’s fast-paced digital age, the gaming industry continues to grow exponentially, capturing the attention of millions worldwide. However, concerns about the negative effects of video games persist, especially among parents. According to a Pew Research study, **46% of parents frequently limit their children's gaming time due to its potential downsides**. Moreover, while there’s a surge of “learning by playing” games in the app market, most are designed for solo players, leaving those who crave competition or want to measure their true skills in the dark.

Athoni is here to tackle these challenges head-on by creating a gaming platform that merges entertainment with meaningful learning experiences, all while fostering healthy social interactions
