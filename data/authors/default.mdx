Welcome to my portfolio - Thoughts from a wandering mind. I am a full-stack software engineer and co-founded Athoni, a game-based learning platform, where I served as CEO and CTO. 

**Programming Journey:**
Regarding my career journey, I was exposed to programming from the 6th grade and have been deeply passionate about it since then. In my secondary and high schools, while my peers were spending their time on leisure activities like gaming, I focused on honing my programming skills and developing a ton of side projects, instead. (see my notable projects here). In terms of my very first achivement, it is when I  developed a new project from scratch and  launched it during my 9th grade, which fortunately attracted many users. (see here)

**Expertise:** 
As my CV demonstrates, I am highly proficient in Javascript and its related frameworks involved, whether it's for frontend, mobile, or backend development. In contrast, I just have a mere understanding and experience of Python, Java, C++, Dart. 

In terms of my interests, I have experience in various aspects of software development, such as  UI/UX design, turning them into frontend code, designing distributed and scalable system, devops, ...

**Algorithm:** 
Having been passionate about computers since childhood, I actively sought opportunities to join competitive programming and olympiad teams. While working on my own projects, I also spent time practicing numerous algorithm problems. As a result, I achieved several notable accomplishments at the city level:

 1. Computer Science Competition (2nd -  2016) (Học sinh giỏi Tin học)
 2. Youth Informatics Competition (3rd - 2017) (Tin học trẻ)
 3. Informatics Olympic (Silver medal - 2018) (Olympic Tin học)
 4. Computer Science Competition (3rd -  2020) (Học sinh giỏi Tin học)

**Personality:** 
Firstly, I would use the word "perfectionist" to describe myself. I strive for perfection in everything I do. That's why when I create or learn something new, I enjoy diving deep into these development aspects. This is evident in my previous projects, which often required diverse technical stacks.

Secondly, leadership is another quality I possess. Throughout my university journey, I have consistently taken on the role of leader in project teams, whether for specialized projects or simply academic purposes. This was not solely due to my confidence and skills but also because I earned the trust of my team members. This trust translated into remarkable teamwork achievements, including consistently earning top grades in class projects.

**Others:** 
IELTS 7.0 (W 7.5)
